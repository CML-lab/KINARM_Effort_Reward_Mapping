# KINARM_Force_Reward_Mapping

This is a basic isometric force matching task on the Kinarm. This task has two parts: an MVC assessment, and a force-reward mapping test that has two phases: a query phase and an execution phase .

In the MVC assessment, participants are asked to flex about a single joint as much as possible and maintain that level of force for a brief time; successful holds are those that maintain the force within some range for the trial duration. The MVC force is recorded on each successful trial, and all successful trials are averaged to estimate the MVC.

The force-reward mapping task is designed to assess how much effort participants are willing to exert for a given reward. In the query phase, participants will see a series of force-reward pairs and will be asked whether they would "accept" or "reject" each pair. If they accept a trial, they may potentially be asked to produce that level of force in the execution phase for the chance to earn the proposed reward. All force production is isometric about a single joint, and in terms of percentages of the MVC.
